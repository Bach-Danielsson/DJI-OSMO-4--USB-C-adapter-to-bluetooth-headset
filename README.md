An adapter for DJI OSMO 4  supporting connecting any brand of headset with bluetooth connectivity ie. Bose A20/A30

Today only DJI bluetoth mic can be connected with the action camera, idea is to make an usb-c adapter alowing all barnds of mic with bluethoth connection to be connected.
Ther is a Boya dapter for connecting external mic to the usb-c port, its for wired mics.
